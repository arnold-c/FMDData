# Overview of ICAR Reports

Each table relating to pre- and post-vaccination seroprevalence estimates was extracted into its own table with the filename denoting the report and state/vaccination round associated with it, as appropriate.

## General Notes

- In 2004, FMD Control Programme initiated
    - 54 districts
    - 6 monthly vaccinations with inactivated trivalent vaccine
    - Progressively expanded to entire country by 2018-19
    - 200 pre and post vaccination samples were collected from each district following a simple random sampling technique
        - SRS repeated at each monthly vaccination
- 2019 National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) launched
    - To control FMD and Brucellosis
    - Vaccinate:
        - 100% cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig population for FMD
        - 100% bovine female calves of 4-8 months of age for Brucellosis
    - Weighted sampling of animals
    - 5:4:1 (6-12mo : 13-24mo : >24mo)
    - Serum sample collected before vaccination and 21 to 30 days post vaccination
- Tests used:
    - Initially Liquid Phase Blocking ELISA (LPBE) test until 2015
    - Solid Phase Competitive ELISA (SPCE) in four dilution format was developed (2015 onwards)
        - 1.8 log10 @ 35% inhibition considered protective threshold between 2015-20
        - 1.65 log10 @ 50% inhibition considered protective threshold 2021 onwards
            - When the previous 1.8 log10 threshold had been used at the start of a vaccination round in the prior year i.e., NADCP-1 spanned 2020 and 2021 annual reports, it was continued for consistency

| Additional information | Unlike other "organized farm" tables, 2020 provides information about specific farm vaccination results: "In most of the organized farms, four monthly vaccinations have been practised without fail". Despite this statement, only 2 out of the 9 listed farms provide 4x vaccination results. The majority only provide 2x vaccination results. There is not information about the timing (or sampling strategy) of these vaccination results |

### 2019

In 2019, the report is presented differently to 2020 onwards.
Instead of presenting vaccination results by round, they are presented by state in a figure with an inset table with seroprevalence numbers.
The accompanying text does not provide count information that can be ascribed to a particular year/round, only summaries of multiple rounds up until 2019.
